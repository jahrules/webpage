In what is *very likely* an unprecedented event; this past weekend (5/20-5/21)
PyPI.org suspended new user creation and new project additions.

As explained in their [incident page:](https://status.python.org/incidents/qy2t9mjjcc7g)
a shortage of staff combined with the pace of malicious uploads has grown to a level that
PyPI didn't feel they could keep up over the weekend (Read: they needed a break)

I rather suspect that the increased volume of malware is a side effect of recent media attention on
the PyPI repository as an attack vector as well as increased reporting by security organizations
such as Vipyr Security who scan PyPI's repositories for threat actors.

Regardless the net effect is
Python's official package repository **shut itself down to new users and new projects for 48 hours.**
wow!

By no means do I blame PyPI.org for taking this decision; nor do I think this is a decision they took lightly...

But I do think that this highlights how big of a problem threat actors have become to the Python package repository
and we can only hope that the folks at PyPI.org can reach a long term solution sooner than later.
