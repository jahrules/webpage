      <description>In what is very likely an unprecedented event; this past weekend (5/20-5/21) PyPI.org suspended new user creation and new project additions.
As explained in their incident page: the volume of malware has grown to a level that the administrators couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up. (Read: they needed a break)
I, rather suspect that the volume of malware is a side effect of recent media attention on the PyPI repository as an attack vector combined with the efforts of security organizations such a Vipyr Security in scanning PyPI&amp;rsquo;s repositories for threat actors.</description>
